            Omnizonk seeks to answer: what does it sound like when you play all equal divisions of an interval at once?

            "Zonk" was a word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_Darreg" target="_blank">Ivor Darreg</a> used
            to characterize the feeling some equal divisions of the octave could give you. The connection is tenuous,
            but "omnizonk" is my word, inspired by Darreg's, for the feeling that <i>every</i> note of <i>all</i>
            divisions at once would give you.

            This software is far from capable of overlaying all equal divisions up to infinity. In fact, it crashes
            above 67 of them. By that point the effect has really begun to materialize though. It's a wash of nearby
            frequencies yes, but not a random wash. A hierarchy of frequency intensities forms. Every equal division
            shares one pitch: the root. Every even equal division shares the halfway point, whether it be 1/2, 2/4, 3/6,
            or 33/66. So we get these peaks of frequency. Moreover, nearby these peaks there are gaps where few
            frequencies fall, so they are especially pronounced. You can see this texture in the Farey sequence below.

            Omnizonk is also designed to let you hear just the unique zonk of all notes at once in a given equal
            division. It also supports equal divisions of windows other than the octave. It also supports filtering
            divisions that are multiples of numbers up to a threshold, if you want to reduce that clustering effect
            described above.
